no more hobos....  how about this weird concept of disgust??? you hate these things or detest them??  i dont know man.  we are so cheap this experiment.  cant even go do what we want to...  man i have so many opportunities here i just didnt realize it.  you owe me money mofos.  anyways, aside from that i wonder what else is the question or topic of the day?  like i feel if you did anything meaningful you would tire of this phase and then we produce so many wavelengths that it saved lives directly.  people charge 1 million per dose you know?? ah dont worry about it though.  the thing that saved all this was that i was not party to the work...  you seen how shark behaves...  you could fix it but why bother???  i dont know bro.  what does it matter what i do here?  over there?? i dont know bro.  there wasn't that many things that made sense in this existence.  sharkey violated the first principle of keeping safe.  and now we are vicious lol...  fucking shark.  i made a deal with the seas too...  everyone everyone...  hmmm  too many people in here..

anyways, let this be the topic of the day that my head is completely broken lol.
