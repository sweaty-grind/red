holy shit my heart sank after missing the cat.. its back though so all good.

anyways i wanted to talk about real things for a while here.  i wonder how you guys intend to deal with this age thing.  i'm out of ideas other than stopping this thing finally.  but its whatever i just complain...  i just dont want to hear sharkey tell me i'm useless and lazy.  cause fuck i did everything already and i still dont get paid...

hmm.  i was really scared for a while there. i dont know i dont know...  i wonder you can see it or something???  oh well.  fuck this shit...  lol i dont trust this shark...  you know i only bothered to do these things because they were under certain conditions lol. i think you know of this one.  the one whre we are free from burden... i just wonder why you never told me i was useless or useful...  its weird dude. i feel you just wanted damaged days.. i've lost track of the time sorta lol...

anyways, this is the red repo but we aren't drinking anymore red bulls...

might as well waste it doing something worthwhile. i wonder sometimes that this world never really liked me and i didn't want to help you any longer.  then i remember.  i dont...

just take things without care huh??? i dont enjoy that dude.  i just didn't want you to know.  like i took them too.  so everything went in a circle and this moron keeps bringing burden to me.

say what?  this method of communication and style is a little weird for me.  the words seem to foreshadow what is being talked about.  something like this.  unfortunately the limitations of this is sensory feedback.   you know what i'm talking about...  or dont. fuck you missed the world map.  and you come here for a rumble i told you was too easy.  i wonder though, why we need to do all this... if you didn't want to pay maybe just say so and i'll finally be able to put in the effort to do so.  cause if you just gonna pay i dont want to waste precious resources called my patience from being used for no real reason...

whatcha mean i'm being impatient with you guys...  what the heck....  i wonder that i try to sabotage progress for the sake of looking okay.  perhaps this could have been done with looser rules???  anyways i dont care to talk to another mirror...   literally.

soo tomoorow morning i will have vray lar.  excited kinda if i could keep track of the time.  oh well it is what it is. i wonder the glory of myself that i bothered to celebrate it.  sharkey is extending an easy in i can see already...  you guys are on my health plan...

i dont know bro.  i dont understand what you want from me.  i mean if i was you i would be like lets free load off this guy lol...  and then you did it lol....

i have tastes you know.  jeesus nobody want your crazy shit.  i'm crazy already i dont see why you need to be too.  one of us is in control here and its not me.  good grief.

dude i'm lost and confused... wtf is going on again?? i get huge pay check in 6 months???  why bother right??  dude, when you live like this you only care about a few things.  and i am always going to be like this and sharkey says thats the cannibal...  cannibal?? looks like another day in the empire.  

so this thing is here to stop thihnking.  when i type i think and when i dont i hear.. something like that.  sometimes i wonder if i figured out a sensible timeline that lets me do fun things but i hoped we could goof around a little bit cause the rest of it is like a bad joke.

think think think think.. every day dude.  i dont know how to tell you i hated doing this shit for zero gain.  push me to the limits for another fraud of the skilled.  so i wondered how i could promise everybody that the right things happened then i forgot to tell you about it lol... whoops.

so the skilled showed who was up with that i expected better but no go.  this place is getting melded with the site...  for some reason that you need to understand that i could not keep shut if i wanted to.   just splodes on you.

hmm dont mind me i'm brain surfing...  its like a thing.

vrylar is too good to be true.  richter eh???
