holy shit my heart sank after missing the cat.. its back though so all good.

anyways i wanted to talk about real things for a while here.  i wonder how you guys intend to deal with this age thing.  i'm out of ideas other than stopping this thing finally.  but its whatever i just complain...  i just dont want to hear sharkey tell me i'm useless and lazy.  cause fuck i did everything already and i still dont get paid...

hmm.  i was really scared for a while there. i dont know i dont know...  i wonder you can see it or something???  oh well.  fuck this shit...  lol i dont trust this shark...  you know i only bothered to do these things because they were under certain conditions lol. i think you know of this one.  the one whre we are free from burden... i just wonder why you never told me i was useless or useful...  its weird dude. i feel you just wanted damaged days.. i've lost track of the time sorta lol...

anyways, this is the red repo but we aren't drinking anymore red bulls...

might as well waste it doing something worthwhile. i wonder sometimes that this world never really liked me and i didn't want to help you any longer.  then i remember.  i dont...
