man wtf are we doing nowadays???  i dont nkow you guys.  i'm not having fun but this is a treasure trove. i wonder you understand the term opportunity costs???  nothing is truly for free.  stuff like this.. i dont know bro. i'm tired but this med is starting to become too much on the third day i think it is now???  so this whole thing looks like easy road.  just wait for the standard to rise before you do shit...  sharkey owes me monees but he's a beggar.  i have this thing where i never touched sharkey's inner mind cause he gets too riled up and shit.  you wouldn't understand but i expect you to...

so sometimes i disagree with what we do.  then i remembered...  pain and suffering is  a thing?   why you guys get the money pass??  oh well who cares. i wonder if i keep doing what i'm doing i'll be rich as fuck.  i just didn't want to expose your retarded ass so i couldn't press anything on you.  you are too fragile myk friend...
